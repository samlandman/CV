## Sam Landman

University of Cambridge graduate, qualified accountant (ACA) specialising in Xero, with hands-on operational experience in two tech startups. I'm looking for an exciting junior developer role in a company that has an engineer-led Agile mindset and is somewhere I can make a difference from day one.

## Skills

#### User Feedback
At both startups, I was responsible for interviewing users and understanding what they used the product for and any pain points. At Dojo, I conducted hundreds of user feedback calls, and relayed the information back to the lead designer and development team. This drove a significant part of the development focus. At Jukedeck, I was reponsible for outreach and obtaining the first users.

#### Don't Repeat Yourself
I'm lazy at heart, and I hate doing things repetitively. Whilst at my accounting firm, I built a tool that analyzed financial information pulled from Xero that enabled me to pinpoint my focus on specific areas. Part of my role was also to streamline accounting processes at my clients to obtain better information more quickly. Where possible, I try to create efficient processes that stop me from wasting time. 

#### Team Player
